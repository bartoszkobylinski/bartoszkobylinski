# *I’m sailor on the vast ocean of code*

## Hi I'm Bartek

As you probably already though. Dude what a pathetic sentence.

As I’m going through github repositories almost everywhere is nothing about author just plain push statistic and numbers of repo. I wouldn’t like to be another random and soulless repository.

###### Let me tell my story.

One of my biggest hobby is sailing. I am a sailor… I have a small boat and I’m sailing on it. What it learns me…
You have to be prepared for a bad weather…..
Rain will come
You will experience storms and enourmous waves,
Your boat will be damaged, and experinece wild forces

but….

You will love sunrises and sunsets, calm and peacfull drives when light wind blows.
Waves will be addicting so much that when you are at ground you'll feel some wired longing at the back of your head. Harsh weather??? You will love it. Nothing wakes you up better than furious wave smash on your had with cold water.

###### Is it familiar for you?

###### How the coding journey looks like?

Could you change waves for some bugs, storms for some big bug, sunsets and sunrises for that moments when you run your code and it works!
Coding is my journey. The longest I have ever started and I really regret not having started this earlier, but hey it’s never to late to start something new. I’m not treating coding as a way to earn money. No! I have try many things other than software devolping but none of it was so inspiring, so facinating, so demanding that all levels of my couriosity just bloom like a flower. I’m constanly learning better coding. I think how to code better and, yes I’m saling through vast ocean of code. I will fail many times. I will makes bugs, bugs and bugs again and again. That’s the life. I’m coding and I love to do that.
